The Project is configured with Java 17 (which is only compatible with Maven >= 3.8), but if you want to use Java 11 you
can too -- just downgrade the version in the POMs.

To confirm that you have them installed and which versions they are, run in the terminal:

```
javac -version
mvn -version
```

### Installation

```
mvn clean install
```

## Built With
